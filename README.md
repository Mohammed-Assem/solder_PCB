## Description
This project is a simple PCB circuit designed in **KiCad** where 3 LEDs are controlled individually ‚Äî 3 by push buttons, and 1 by a **light-dependent resistor (LDR)** instead of a regular resistor. The LDR allows the LED to light up automatically in the dark, acting like a simple light sensor.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

- **LED 1**: Controlled by push button 1  
- **LED 2**:  Controlled by **LDR** ‚Äî it lights up in darkness!
- **LED 3**: Controlled by push button 2 

This makes it not only a manual control circuit but also a **light-reactive system**.
